                Configure Windows Defender
            </h3>
            One thing to mention at the top, for Windows human users,
            <br>If Windows Defender isn't holding too much system resources,
            <br>keep Defender running is the best solution.
            <br>
            <br>You must achieve the abilities to protect yourself from chaos,
            <br>otherwise, install a third-party anti-virus software.
            <br>I left Windows Defender running on my workstation,
            <br>but turn Defender off on most virtual machines.
            <br>
            <br>Make this decision beware.
            <br>
            <br>To turn off Windows Defender in 1909, you need to turn off Tamper Protection first,
            <br>then use group policy to actually turn off Windows Defender. It can't be turn off by group policy directly.
