                Information about high dpi
            </h3>
            Since Windows 10, dpi not a annoying problem often.
            <br>So all about high dpi in here is for more luxury experience.

            <h3>
                Integer ratio scaling
            </h3>
            There is a <a href=https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/844905/geforce-drivers/-feature-request-nonblurry-upscaling-at-integer-ratios/>discuss</a> on nvidia forum,
            <br>unfortunately years later we still don't have valid method to do it.
            <br>A cheap low-end graphic card can't affort 4K resolution modern 3D game.
            <br>When using a 4K monitor, 1080p gaming still an option for 60 FPS.
            <br>
            <br>In Windows 10, right click on a exe file, select Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Change high DPI settings(Version 1803),
            <br>check the "High DPI scaling override" option and select "System" in the drop down menu will able to force scale a program.
            <br>Both "System" and "System (Enhanced)" support integer scale if system general dpi is a multiple of 100%.
            <br>But many program can't reconize "System (Enhanced)" correctly.
            <br>You can notice that only 1/4 displayed on monitor  left top corner, so use "System" instead.
            <br>Final Fantasy XIV have this problem with "System (Enhanced)" and work with "System".

                Borderless windowed fullscreen
            </h3>
            For the fullscreen programs, a 3rd party software able to turn them into borderless windowed mode,
            <br>with a proper resolution settings they can scaled by Windows from 1080p to 4K.
            <br>Here is their project link, you can also buy from Steam.
            <br>To work with Windows scale, both Borderless's exe and target program exe file should also set override to "System"

            <h3>
                Disable fullscreen optimizations
            </h3>
            I actually don't care the enhance, but when using Borderless windowed fullscreen mode,
            <br>with fullscreen optimizations on, once switched into program window,
            <br>the program being blurred even if general dpi is a mutiple of 100%.
            <br>If switch to other window, the blurred disappear.
            <br>Turn off this feature can solve this problem.
            <br>Right click on a exe file, select Properties -&gt; Compatibility, uncheck "Disable fullscreen optimizations".
            <br>
            <br>But I trust this is a incomplete programming result, Microsoft should take care in future.
            <br>I'll try to contact someone later on.

            <h3>
                Performace
            </h3>
            Sadly Windows System scale to 4K caused many program graphics capability lower than usual.
            <br>For Elder Scroll Skyrim Special Edition, may lose 15 more FPS in some cases.
            <br>Hopefully Microsoft can solve this issue or Nvidia implement their hardware integer scale.
