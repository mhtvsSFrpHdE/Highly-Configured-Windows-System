                Configure Windows Search
            </h3>
            You can skip this part if you're relying on this feature.
            <br>Yes, Windows Search is awesome on some pro's hand, those secret features...
            <br>but the more only use it on startup menu to find specify program's shortcuts.
            <br>By default, Windows Search is heavy, a bit slow and do use less real-time internet search at the same time(Version 1803).
            <br>The people don't rely on this feature will feel bad when they just want to open Photoshop,
            <br>but Windows takes five seconds to search a simple "lnk"(Windows shortcuts file extension name).
            <br>And Cortana displays a Bing search result about Photoshop.
            <br>Lots of system resource holds in this workflow, but most import thing is,
            <br>it's not fast enough.
            <h3>
                Indexing Options
            </h3>
            To make Windows Search(Startup menu search) become a program launcher you ever meet in Phone,
            <br>execute the following steps.
            <ol>
                <li><a href=/Pages/HowTo/OpenControlPanelWindows10.html>Open Control Panel</a></li>
                <li>Open Indexing Options</li>
                <li>Modify</li>
                <li>remove all checkbox item and left only "Start Menu"</li>
                <li>Click on OK button to save changes, suddenly Windows begins to remove entries other than Start menu</li>
            </ol>
            Close Indexing Options, soon Windows Search will have faster response.
            <br>This setting makes Windows Search feature only cache search Start Menu shortcuts now.
            <br>My suggestion "Remove other location" may not cover your working files, so, apply this setting or not by your choice.
            <h3>
                Turn off Web results(Search suggestions)
            </h3>
            After 1803 update, group policy doesn't work to block web search.(Pro Version)
            <br>I don't care about all the tech details but I don't glad to see web result.
            <br>Luckily people on the internet found the solution that can prevent web results.
            <br>There is a discussion on Reddit: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/8adtho/scu1803_no_longer_possible_to_disable_web_search/>[SCU/1803] No longer possible to disable web search and search suggestions in Search</a>
            <br>In the reply of user jakegh, he provides a method to use Windows Firewall to avoid this.
            <br>

                    <br>Frustrating and infuriating behavior from MS. If I didn't play games I would have switched to mac years ago.
                    <br>Anyway, I block outgoing connections from searchui.exe in my firewall, hopefully that will stop it.
                    <br>The guys at Shutup10 and/or Winaero will probably figure out how to stop it too.

            <br>If you still need Cortana online features,
            <br>unfortunately, there isn't a method to prevent Web result but keeps Cortana online. (Version 1803) 
            <br>HowTo:
            <ol>
                <li><a href=/Pages/HowTo/OpenControlPanelWindows10.html>Open Control Panel</a></li>
                <li>Open Windows Defender Firewall</li>
                <li>Advanced settings</li>
                <li>Outbound Rules</li>
            </ol>
