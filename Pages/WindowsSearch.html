            <h3>
                Configure Windows Search
            </h3>
            You can skip this part if you're rely on this feature.
            <br>
            Yes, Windows Search is awesome on some pro's hand, lots of features...
            <br>
            but the more only use it on startup menu to find specify program's shortcuts.
            <br>
            By default, Windows Search is heavy, a bit slow and do use less realtime internet search at the same time.
            <br>
            The people doesn't rely on this feature will feel bad when they just want to open Photoshop,
            <br>
            but Windows use five seconds to search a simple lnk(Windows shortcuts file extension name).
            <br>
            And cortana display a Bing search result about Photoshop.
            <br>
            Lots of system resource holds in this workflow, but most import thing is,
            <br>
            it's not fast enough.
            <br><br>
            To make Windows Search(Startup menu search) become a program launcher you meet in Phone,
            <br>
            <a href=/Pages/HowTo/OpenControlPanelWindows10.html>Open Control Panel</a>
            , find "Indexing Options", click on it.
            <h3>
                Indexing Options
            </h3>
            Click on the Modify button on Indexing Options dialog,
            <br>
            remove all check box item and left only "Start Menu".
            <br>
            Click on OK button to save changes, suddenly Windows begins to remove entries other than Start menu.
            <br>
            Close Indexing Options, soon Windows Search will have fast response.
            <br>
            This settings removed Windows Search features and it can only search Start Menu shortcuts now.
            <br>
            Apply this settings or not, by your choice.
