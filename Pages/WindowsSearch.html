                Configure Windows Search

            You can skip this part if you're relying on this feature.
            <br>Yes, Windows Search is awesome on some pro's hand, those secret features...
            <br>but the more only use it on startup menu to find specify program's shortcuts.
            <br>By default, Windows Search is heavy, a bit slow and do use less real-time internet search at the same time(Version 1803).
            <br>The people don't rely on this feature will feel bad when they just want to open Photoshop,
            <br>but Windows takes five seconds to search a simple "lnk"(Windows shortcuts file extension name).
            <br>And Cortana displays a Bing search result about Photoshop.
            <br>Lots of system resource holds in this workflow, but most import thing is,
            <br>it's not fast enough.
            <h3>
                Indexing Options
            </h3>
            To make Windows Search(Startup menu search) become a program launcher you ever meet in Phone,
            <br>
            Remove any other entry in Indexing Options and only left Start Menu,
            <br>this setting makes Windows Search feature only cache Start Menu shortcuts now, and will have faster response.
            <br>My suggestion "Remove other location" may not cover your working files, so, apply this setting or not by your choice.
            <h3>
                Turn off Web results(Search suggestions)
            </h3>
            After 1803 update, group policy doesn't work to block web search.(Pro Version)
            <br>I don't care about all the tech details but I don't glad to see web result.
            <br>Luckily people on the internet found the solution that can prevent web results.
            <br>There is a discussion on Reddit: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/ex1piz/disable_web_search_start_menu_1909//>disable web search start menu 1909</a>
