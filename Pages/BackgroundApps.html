            <h3>
                Configure Background Apps
            </h3>
            The reason to turn off Background Apps is, as a "modern" operating system,
            <br>
            Windows 10 be smart about some background activity without telling you.
            <br>
            Perform any computer task will take some system resources,
            <br>
            Windows need these system resources for its task, but I need the resources, too.
            <br>
            After years of evolution, Windows still not smart enouth to stop its background
            <br>
            activities while I'm using PC for task.
            <br>
            Some of the background activity appears as Store apps, and can block in here.
            <br><br>
            <a href=/Pages/HowTo/OpenSettingsWindows10.html>Open Settings App</a>
            , select Privacy, then found "Background apps" in the left hand side,
            <br>
            click and switch to Background apps options.
            <br>
            Left the main switch to On, don't turn it off.
            <br><br>
            I know this seems strange, but due to Windows 10 version 1709,
            <br>
            turn this off will also shut down some of the startup menu features that invisible in this list.
            <br>
            In my case, turn this off and then Search Index will not update new contents.
            <br>
            So in order to prevent background apps, turn all apps on the list to Off,
            <br>
            but keep the apps you wish to allow background activities.
			<br><br>
			In my case, I have "Settings", "Mail", "Alarms" enabled.
