            <h3>
                    Configure Windows Update
            </h3>
            <a href=/Pages/HowTo/OpenSettingsWindows10.html>Open settings app</a>
            , Select "Update &amp; security" -> "Windows Update".
            <br>
            In this interface, there're some important button under Update status section.
            <br><br>
            They're:
            <ul>
                <li>Change active hours</li>
                <li>Restart options</li>
                <li>Advanced options</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Restart options
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Turn on "Show more notifications".
            </h4>
            Once you've done it, click the "&larr;" button on title bar to back to privous interface.
            <br>
            This will give you a chance to decline computer restart while Windows Update if you have some documents or programs haven't save.
            <br>
            Of course, this will only work when you're not using full screen applications,
            <br>
            otherwise, you still not able to be notified and may timeout to response and get a restart without saving your contents.
            <br>
            You can search "Windows full screen exclusive mode" to get more information.
            <h3>
                Advanced options
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Choose how updates are installed
            </h4>
            Select the checkbox of
            <br>
            "Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows".
            <br>
            This will allow Windows Update to install many other Microsoft products updates like it says,
            <br>
            The reason you should enable it is security.
            <br>
            Latest security of Microsoft products will delever to you soon once they're available and you don't need to worry about them.
            <h4>
                Choose when updates are installed
            </h4>
            I would not recommended the "Current Branch" for anyone,
            <br>
            this can bring you more restart request from Windows Update.
            <br>
            But if you get interested in latest Windows feature just like me, during the redstone update,
            <br>
            turn it to "Current Branch" and be excited.
            <br>
            Otherwize, use "Current Branch for Business".
            <br>
            You'll still get security updates, but feature updates will come more lately until they're stable enough.
            <h4>
                Pause Updates
            </h4>
            I understand many people hate Windows Update
            <br>
            and hope their fantastic Windows XP can up and running forever, without updates.
            <br>
            As a programmer, I would say, hey, you know nothing about power.
            <br>
            Don't turn this off, use it only if you're facing a pain can't reboot for hours.
            <br>
            You can turn it off while gaming or broadcast, but turn it back on once you're done.
            <br>
            Lack latest feature update won't hurt you,
            <br>
            but when lacking security updates, the hackers can steal anything from you
            <br>
            even if you're simply connect your device to internet and do nothing else.
            <br>
            Search "0day" for more information.
            <br>
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)>A quick introduction on Wikipedia</a>.
            <br>
            Even Updates won't protect you in many event, but it can maximum your defence.
            <h4>
                Choose how updates are delivered
            </h4>
            I left this options to off.
            <br>
            This options can speed up your Updates download speed,
            <br>
            but as the price that Microsoft not telling you explicit,
            <br>
            Windows will keep a cache on your system drive in order to share them to others,
            <br>
            and downcrase your hard drive performance while others need updates from you.
            <br>
            On another hand, keep extra cache files on SSD drives may reduce SSD life cycle.
            <br>
            I don't know, up to your manufacturers.
            <br>
            Make a decision according to your faith.
