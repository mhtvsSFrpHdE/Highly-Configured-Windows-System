                    Configure Windows Update
            </h3>
            I don't remember the details in the past years.
            <br>Windows Update often broke important progress unexpected.
            <br>In the early version, if Windows Update detect people trying to disable Update by REGEDIT, group policy, or service,
            <br>Windows will even auto download a tool called "Windows 10 Update Assitant".
            <br>This is a terrible software because it downloads the new version of Windows 10 in the background,
            <br>Once download completed, it popped up a dialog that requests a reboot,
            <br>the user can choose reboot now or delay.
            <br
            <br>Sounds not that bad huh, the thing is, this dialog has a 10-minute timer,
            <br>if you can't respond in 10 minutes, a reboot is automatically.
            <br>The dialog may not able to get a response from the user for several reasons,
            <br>aborted from keyboard, buy foods, constipation, full-screen gaming, etc.
            <br>You may have important program have to always online.
            <br>For example, Minecraft server, remote desktop solution, etc.
            <br>A reboot will not automatically reboot those service for you so they will offline for a long time until you get back to the computer.
            <br>We have seen a lot youtube lost their game and get a reboot because of Windows Update.
            <br>The same situation happened to me. I have all known safety measures to block Windows Update,
            <br>but I still get a reboot while I'm going outdoors. I trust this is caused by Windows 10 Update Assitant. (Early 1703 Version)
            <br>On the recent 1709 and 1803, I trust Windows 10 will not reboot without user permitive. "Thank you", Microsoft.
            
            <h3>
                Pause Updates
            </h3>
            I understand many people hate Windows Update
            <br>and hope their fantastic, perfect Windows XP can up and running forever, without updates.
            <br>As a programmer(Self-proclaimed), I would say, hey, you know nothing about power.
            <br>Lack latest feature update won't hurt you,
            <br>but when lacking security updates, the hackers can steal anything from you
            <br>even if you simply connect your device to the internet and do nothing else.
            <br>Serval known Windows security breach proves this.
            <br>Don't turn this off, use it only if you're facing a pain can't reboot for hours.
            <br>You can turn it off while gaming or broadcast but turn it back on once you're done. 
            <br>
            <br>EDIT: Since version 1803, the auto reboot isn't a problem anymore.
            <br>But if you hope your gaming performance doesn't affect by Windows Update,
            <br>Here is two script for the alternative. And these are faster than settings app click-click-click.
            <br>Even I did a stop Windows Update service request in the script,
            <br>a system reboot may still be required to work properly.
            <br>Right click the script and choose "Run as Administrator".
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href=/Resources/WindowsUpdate/WindowsUpdateDisable1703.cmd>WindowsUpdateDisable.cmd</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href=/Resources/WindowsUpdate/WindowsUpdateEnable1703.cmd>WindowsUpdateEnable.cmd</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Choose how updates are delivered
            </h3>
            I left this options to off.
            <br>This options can speed up your Updates download speed,
            <br>but as the price that Microsoft not telling you explicit,
            <br>Windows will keep a cache on your system drive in order to share them to others,
            <br>and downgrade your hard drive performance while others need updates from you.
            <br>On another hand, keep extra cache files on SSD drives may reduce SSD life cycle.
            <br>I don't know, up to your manufacturers.
            <br>Make a decision according to your faith.
